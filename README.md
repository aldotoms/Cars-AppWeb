Description: Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Phyton.
In this Cars-AppWeb you can find data of car sales advertisements in the USA.

In it you can generate a histogram, view a scatterplot and create a barplot with the following information:

    1. Histogram: shows the number of cars sold per odometer.
    2. Dispersion: shows the odometer and price relationship.
    3. Bar: shows the odometer, the model year and the fuel type.

Feel free of exploring the data as you like.
Thank you for visiting.
